# fuel-efficiency-prediction-model-using-machine-learning
This project predicts the fuel efficiency (miles per gallon - MPG) of vehicles using machine learning. By analyzing automotive features such as engine displacement, number of cylinders, weight, horsepower, acceleration, and model year, the system estimates a car’s fuel economy.

Source: Kaggle – Auto MPG Dataset

Attributes Used:

displacement → Engine displacement (cubic inches)

cylinders → Number of cylinders

weight → Vehicle weight (lbs)

horsepower → Engine horsepower

acceleration → Time to accelerate (0–60 mph, in seconds)

model year → Year of manufacture

mpg → Fuel efficiency (target variable)
